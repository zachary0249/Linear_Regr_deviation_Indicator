# Linear_Regr_deviation_Indicator
Technical Analysis Tool


This program provides a financial technical analysis tool capable of providing standard deviation channels with respect to a given time frame. The intention was that it's fully customizable with respect to how many deviations to include, whether to plot the result or not, what time frame to look at, how long of a window the linear regression calculation should include, as well as what stock to look at with the necessary data collection built in too. The output of the program results in a matrix which gives you the most recent price in the given time interval, as well as how far that price is (in %) with respect to the desired standard deviations both above and below the current price.

I hope that people will be able to find use out of this and additionally feel free to provide any pull requests, potential additions, or questions.
